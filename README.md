<h5> 
PS: I did this project as a group for the Zencon Hackathon 2023. Therefore, the project is not the result of my work alone, but of a group of 5 people. 

Since it is only possible to make a fork, with the respective commit history, with private visibility; I decided to copy the project. So I can include a web3 project in my portfolio. </h5>
